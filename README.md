# FoxHound
This is a simple haskell implementation of the Fox and Hound game using the [brick](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick) library.
It is built using the stack tool, to run install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), clone the repo and run [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) run in the cloned directory.

Use tab to switch between the board and menu, Enter to select a menu entry and space to "click" on the board with the cursor.
